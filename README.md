web app — Songs Library/Search — AP Course work. Spring MVC, Hibernate.

project have almost everything the teachers want from it. In plans: add account-management system and roles. cuz now everybody can simply create, edit and delete entities from DB. I guess, this should be only admin-users privilege. also I nedd to do something with footer but for now it looks kinda ok. maybe I will add something more in future. but I really want to rewrite the whole project on Rust lang.
